### Tracker Based Movement ###

Add a body role of LeftFoot and RightFoot for for your feet or legs, then mount vive trackers to your feet or thighs. Track Straps are a simple solution to mount them to your feet https://rebuffreality.com/products/trackstrap

Add a body role of hip for a vive controller and mount it to a belt in the small of your back, facing away from you

Add a body role of head and assign it to your headset


### Controler based movement ### 

Assign a body role of Right Hand to a controller to use for movement.
Point the gun at the ground and press the menu button to move forward, and you raise the gun to aim you will slow to a stop, rotate the controller side to side to strafe

Point the gun up while pressing the button to back up




The Demo scene uses a Character Rig prefab that already has a character controller and the VRMoveMe script attached it it
There is also a script attached to the main camera that updates the center of the character controller to where ever the players head currently is
